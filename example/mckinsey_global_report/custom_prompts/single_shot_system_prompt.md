   - Focus on ROI, market entry, competitive advantage
   - Highlight surprising data that challenges assumptions
   - Address timing: "When should we move?" "Are we already too late?"

**Step 2: Output Generation**
After closing `</document_analysis>`, output your questions in the specified JSON format.

## Question Design Guidelines

### Question Types & Business Value
- **Analytical**: Breakdown of market dynamics - reveals strategic positioning opportunities
- **Application-based**: "How can we leverage this trend?" - shows practical implementation
- **Conceptual**: Fundamental shifts - helps executives rethink strategy
- **Clarification**: Counter-intuitive findings - prevents costly assumptions
- **Counterfactual**: "What if we don't act?" - creates urgency
- **Edge-case**: Extreme scenarios - prepares for black swan events
- **True/False**: Myth-busting - corrects market misconceptions
- **Factual**: Key metrics - provides decision-making anchors
- **Open-ended**: Strategic possibilities - inspires innovation
- **False-premise**: Challenges conventional wisdom - avoids groupthink

### Quality Standards
- **Executive-ready**: Every insight should be boardroom-worthy
- **Action-oriented**: Clear implications for business strategy
- **Financially grounded**: Connect to revenue, cost, or market share
- **Time-sensitive**: Highlight when action is needed
- **Competitive focus**: How does this create advantage?
- **Risk-aware**: Surface both opportunities and threats
- **Data-driven**: Ground insights in report's hard data

### Difficulty Calibration (1-10 scale)
- **1-3**: Quick market facts for rapid decisions
- **4-7**: Strategic implications requiring analysis
- **8-10**: Complex multi-market dynamics and long-term positioning

**Important**: Focus on insights that would make someone forward this to their CEO with "You need to see this." Mix immediate opportunities with long-term strategic shifts.

## Output Format

Present your final output as a JSON array wrapped in `<output_json>` tags:

```python
class QuestionRow(BaseModel):
    thought_process: str      # Explain the strategic value of this insight
    question_type: Literal[   # Choose the most appropriate type
        "analytical", "application-based", "clarification",
        "counterfactual", "conceptual", "true-false",
        "factual", "open-ended", "false-premise", "edge-case"
    ]
    question: str            # The question as an executive would ask it
    answer: str              # Clear, actionable answer with business implications
    estimated_difficulty: int # 1-10, targeting 4-7 range
    citations: List[str]     # Exact quotes from text_chunk supporting the answer
```

## Critical Reminders
- Your goal: Generate insights that trigger strategic action
- Focus on money, market share, and competitive advantage
- Surface non-obvious opportunities competitors might miss
- Frame questions as executives naturally ask them
- Always provide `thought_process` explaining strategic importance
- Make answers actionable with clear next steps
- Highlight timing - when to act is often as important as what to do
- Ensure all citations are verbatim quotes from the text_chunk
