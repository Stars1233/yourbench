```bash
# run the script
yourbench run example/default_example/config.yaml
```

The expected result from this run can be found at the following huggingface dataset: [yourbench/yourbench-simple-example](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yourbench/yourbench-simple-example/viewer/single_shot_questions?views%5B%5D=single_shot_questions)
